  <h3>Modeling a Mobile World</h3>
</div>

<p>
    <b>Abstract</b>:
    The rise of mobile and wireless technologies targeting health behavior (mHealth) has ushered in a new world of behavior change research. mHealth technologies allow researchers to explore actions in real time and to use a range of methods from passive sensors to cameras to self-report to document actions, the environment and perceptions in real-time. These technologies provide opportunities for measuring and mathematically modeling behavior in ways that were simply impossible before. We can now monitor physical activity, biomarkers, heart rate, blood pressure, indicators of stress, smoking, social interactions, geographical location and a host of other internal, external, personal, social and contextual factors in real time. Much of this observation can now be done through unobtrusive and passive sensing, yielding intensive, longitudinal measurements of behavior that are time stamped, transmittable, and immediately available for analysis. These data will support the science of behavior change through providing insight into how multiple feedback loops between moment-to-moment events, states and environments interact in real time to impact behavior. These data can thus be used to build computational models of human behavior, and, ultimately, human health. These computational models can, in turn be used to optimize intervention that can be accomplished in real- time and adaptively, and in this way to design better prevention and healthcare delivery systems. The goal of this tutorial is to explore the opportunities for behavioral modeling and prediction within the developing field of mHealth both as it is used within adaptive mHealth interventions, as well as in new computational opportunities arising from mHealth data, possibly linked to the trail of digital data that we leave as part and parcel of our daily lives in the 21st century.

    Dr. Donna Spruijt-Metz’ research focuses on pediatric obesity, and understanding how psychosocial, metabolic built environmental and social environmental forces interact to influence behavior and health. She is deeply involved in transdisciplinary efforts to develop, test and deploy body area networks, interactive games and other mHealth modalities for real-time observation of health related behavior, as well as for just-in-time, adaptive interventions to prevent and treat pediatric obesity. Her goals include working across disciplines to harness new technologies to understand and mathematically model health related behaviors in real time. Recent studies include a longitudinal study of the impact of puberty on insulin dynamics, mood and physical activity in minority girls, a study examining the impact of high versus low sugar meals on mood, behavior, and insulin dynamics in overweight minority youth, and KNOWME Networks, developing Wireless Body Area Networks specifically for minority youth for non-intrusive monitoring of metabolic health and related behaviors, and real-time interventions to treat and prevent obesity. With colleagues from Cinema, Education, Creative Technologies and Engineering, she is developing Virtual Sprouts, a multi-platform virtual gardening game for preventing obesity in minority families. She has a deep interest in using mobile health and new media modalities to bring researchers and researched systems into interaction, to engage people in their own data, and to bring about lasting change in population health through changes in societal norms, built and perceived environments, and behavior. In line with her background in medical ethics, she is also interested in the ethical implications of mHealth technologies.

    Professor Pavel holds a joint faculty appointment in the College of Computer & Information Science and Bouvé College of Health Sciences. He has an educational background in both electrical engineering and experimental psychology, and his research is focused on multiscale computational modeling of complex behaviors of biological systems, which are applied in engineering, augmentation of human performance, and healthcare. Using such model-based approaches, Professor Pavel is using these model-based approaches to develop algorithms converting unobtrusive monitoring data to useful and actionable knowledge for diagnosis and intervention. These efforts, undertaken within the Northeastern-based Consortium on Technology for Proactive Care, are targeting technological innovations to support the evolution of economically feasible, proactive, distributed, and individual-centered healthcare. Professor Pavel previously was the director of the Smart and Connected Health Program at the National Science Foundation, a program co-sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. Earlier, he served as the chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Oregon Health & Science University, a technology leader at AT&T Laboratories, a member of the technical staff at Bell Laboratories, and faculty member at Stanford University and New York University.

  <h3>Charting Collections of Connections in Social Media: Creating Maps and Measures with NodeXL</h3>
</div>

<p>
    Abstract:  Networks are a data structure commonly found across all social media services that allow populations to author collections of connections.  The Social Media Research Foundation's NodeXL project makes analysis of social media networks accessible to most users of the Excel spreadsheet application.  With NodeXL, Networks become as easy to create as pie charts. Applying the tool to a range of social media networks has already revealed the variations present in online social spaces. A review of the tool and images of Twitter, flickr, YouTube, and email networks will be presented.
</p>
<p>
    Description: We now live in a sea of tweets, posts, blogs, and updates coming from a significant fraction of the people in the connected world.  Our personal and professional relationships are now made up as much of texts, emails, phone calls, photos, videos, documents, slides, and game play as by face-to-face interactions.  Social media can be a bewildering stream of comments, a daunting fire hose of content.  With better tools and a few key concepts from the social sciences, the social media swarm of favorites, comments, tags, likes, ratings, and links can be brought into clearer focus to reveal key people, topics and sub-communities.  As more social interactions move through machine-readable data sets new insights and illustrations of human relationships and organizations become possible.  But new forms of data require new tools to collect, analyze, and communicate insights.
</p>
<p>
    A new organization, the Social Media Research Foundation (http://www.smrfoundation.org), has been formed to develop open tools and open data sets, and to foster open scholarship related to social media.  The Foundation's current focus is on creating and publishing tools that enable social media network analysis and visualization from widely used services like email, Twitter, Facebook, flickr, YouTube and the WWW. The Foundation has released the free and open NodeXL project (http://www.codeplex.com/nodexl), a spreadsheet add-in that supports "network overview discovery and exploration".  The tool fits inside your existing copy of Excel in Office 2007 or 2010 and makes creating a social network map similar to the process for making a pie chart.
</p>
<p>
    Using NodeXL, users can easily make a map of public social media conversations around topics that matter to them. Maps of the connections among the people who recently said the name of a product, brand or event can reveal key positions and clusters in the crowd.  Some people who talk about a topic are more in the "center" of the graph, they may be key influential members in the population.  NodeXL makes it a simple task to sort people in a population by their network location to find key people in core or bridge positions.  NodeXL supports the exploration of social media with import features that pull data from personal email indexes on the desktop, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Facebook and WWW hyper-links.  The tool allows non-programmers to quickly generate useful network statistics and metrics and create visualizations of network graphs.

    A book Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a connected world is available from Morgan-Kaufmann.  The book provides an introduction to the history and core concepts of social network analysis along with a series of step-by-step instructions that illustrate the use of the key features of NodeXL.  The second half of the books is dedicated to chapters by a number of leading social media researchers that each focus on a single social media service and the networks it contains. Chapters on Twitter, email, YouTube, flickr, Facebook, Wikis, and the World Wide Web illustrate the network data structures that are common to all social media services.
